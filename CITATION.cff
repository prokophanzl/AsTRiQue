abstract: >-
  Perception experiments in phonetics can be time-consuming,
  often requiring participants to label large amounts of
  stimuli. This proposed framework reduces participant
  workload by continuously updating a logistic regression
  model to select the most informative stimuli, making
  high-certainty predictions for the rest. Using simulated
  participants based on real data, the system achieved high
  classification accuracy while significantly lowering the
  number of required participant responses. These results
  demonstrate the potential of active machine learning to
  streamline data collection in perception experiments.
